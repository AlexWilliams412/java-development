        Once upon a time a girl named Goldilocks lived in
        a house at the edge of the woods. In those days
        curls of hair were called "locks."  She was
        "Goldilocks" because golden hair ran down her head
        and shoulders.

        One morning Goldilocks was out for a walk when she
        came across a beautiful bird.  She followed that
        bird right into the woods, where her mother had
        said many times she must never go.  But Goldilocks
        didn’t think of that.

        Deeper and deeper into the woods she went. But
        where was the bird?  It was nowhere to be seen.
        Goldilocks looked around.  That's when she knew
        she was lost.

                But a house was not far away.  “I wonder who lives
        there,” she thought, "so deep into the woods."

        She went up and knocked on the door.  No answer.
        She knocked again.  Still no answer.  Goldilocks
        knocked a third time and the door opened. But no
        one was behind the door.
        "I may as well go in."

        Goldilocks smelled a wonderful smell, and soon
        knew why. On the table were three steaming bowls
        of oatmeal.  All of a sudden she realized how very
        hungry she was.

                What Goldilocks did not know, however, is that
        three bears lived in this house.  In fact, that
        very morning the three bears had sat down to their
        bowls of oatmeal but the cereal was too hot.  So
        they had decided to take a short walk.  They said
        to each other, "By the time we return home our
        oatmeal will be perfect."

        Gazing at the steaming bowls of oatmeal, Goldilocks
        thought, “I'm sure whoever lives here won’t mind if
        I take just one sip.” She sat at the first chair
        and took a sip.  “Ah!” she said, “it is too h
        She moved to the next bowl and took a sip.  “Ah!”
        she said, “it is too cold.”

        She moved to the third bowl and took a sip.  “It is
        just right!” And before she knew it, the oatmeal
        was all gone.

                Goldilocks rubbed her tummy.  “I'm full! I must
        find somewhere to sit that's more comfortable.”

        She went to the living room.  Three chairs were
        lined up in a row – one big chair, one medium-sized
        chair, and a wee little chair.

        Three chairs were lined up in a row.
        "I'm sure whoever lives here will not mind if I sit
        on just one chair,” said Goldilocks. She sat on the
        big chair, but it was too hard.

"The next chair looks good,” said Goldilocks.  She
        moved to the medium-sized chair, but it was too soft.
        "The wee little chair looks better,” said the girl.
                She sat on the little chair and it was just right!
                But when Goldilocks leaned back a bit, the chair
        broke into a dozen pieces.  She plopped right on
        the floor.
        "Oh, no!” Goldilocks wailed. Then she yawned.
                There must be somewhere she could lie down for a
        short nap.

        "Oh, no!" Goldilocks wailed.

        The girl saw a ladder and climbed it to an attic.
                In a row, three beds were lined up – one big bed,
                one medium-sized bed, and a wee little bed.
        "I'm sure whoever lives here won’t mind if I lay
        down for just a short nap"" she said.  She laid
        down on the big bed but it was too hard.  She laid
        down on the medium-sized bed but it was too soft.
        The girl laid down on the wee little bed, and it
        was just right!  As her head hit the pillo
